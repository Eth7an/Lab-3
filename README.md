# Lab-3
Computer Architecture Lab Assignment

For this lab, I have created a register file for a processor which uses RISC-V ISA. The register file has 32 registers with 32-bit width.

To create this register file, I also be designed a register that takes 32-bit width input data and gives an output of 32-bit width data, a decoder that takes a 5-bit input and decodes it to a 32-bit output, and a multiplexer that takes 32 input signals with 32-bit width and outputs one at 32-bit width. Each of these modules is instantiated one or multiple times (in the case of the register) in order to create the functioning register file.
